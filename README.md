# 📊 Stock Market Forecasting Project

## 🔗 Dataset Source

We use publicly available historical stock market datasets from:

- [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/)

The dataset typically includes the following columns:
- `Open`
- `Close`
- `High`
- `Low`
- `Volume`
- `Date` as index

## 🛠 Operations Performed

### ✅ 1. Data Collection
- Collect stock data using APIs like `yfinance` or Alpha Vantage.
- Save raw and processed versions in `data/`.

### ✅ 2. Preprocessing
- Handle nulls and missing dates.
- Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.
- Create lag features and rolling averages.

### ✅ 3. Visualization
- Time series plots
- Moving averages
- ACF/PACF analysis
- Seasonal decomposition (trend/seasonality/residual)

### ✅ 4. Model Training
- **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA)
- **Prophet** (by Meta)
- **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory - Keras)

### ✅ 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Grid Search (for ARIMA/SARIMA)
- Epochs, batch size, hidden units (for LSTM)

### ✅ 6. Model Evaluation
- MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R² Score
- Forecast vs Actual plots
- Residual diagnostics

### ✅ 7. Model Saving
- Save models using `pickle` or `joblib`
- Save LSTM using `.h5` or `SavedModel` format

### ✅ 8. Deployment
- Build interactive web app using **Streamlit**
- Upload to **Render**, **Streamlit Cloud**, or **Heroku**

### ✅ 9. Documentation & Presentation
- Prepare video demo explaining model pipeline and UI
- Final PowerPoint presentation
- Document code in GitHub repo
